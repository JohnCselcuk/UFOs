# UFO's

Use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a custom webpage that showcases different UFO sightings around the world.

## Overview
The goal of this analysis is to create a webpage with a dynamic table that shows the filtered results of the UFO sightings data. The original webpage that was created only provided users with a date filter. However, for this project, we want to allow users to filter the data with more than just the date. Additional filters for the table will include city, state, country, and shape.
