# UFO's

Use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a custom webpage that showcases different UFO sightings around the world.

## Overview
The goal of this analysis is to create a webpage with a dynamic table that shows the filtered results of the UFO sightings data. The original webpage that was created only provided users with a date filter. However, for this project, we want to allow users to filter the data with more than just the date. Additional filters for the table will include city, state, country, and shape.

### We have used several Tools and technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- Visual Studio Code
- Google Chrome

## Results
Previously, the webpage included only a date filter in which users needed to click on a button for the filter to be applied. With the new updated version, users will be able to filter data, simply by inputting a criteria into one of the filter fields. The webpage will then automatically filter the table to display relevant data. The first image ilustrates the table without filters. Users can see the type of format that is required for the filter to function in the text box. Upon input, the table will automatically filter the results accordingly.

## Summary
One drawback of this webpage is that it is currently unable to resize in relation to the device it is viewed on. Some portion of the webpage, such as the image, is able to resize if the user magnifies the webpage, however, the webpage as a whole is unable to do so. Thus, one recommendation for further development would be to add formatting that readjusts the sections and margins when the page is viewed on a mobile device or tablet.

Another addition that can be made to the webpage is a survey form. The survey would ask about the users' experience with extraterrestial sightings. It can include questions such as a description for what they saw, duration, general geographic location, and other interesting details. This way, we can expand our table and database by including new user sightings.
